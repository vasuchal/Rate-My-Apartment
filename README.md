# Rate My Apartment

Project Summary
Our project is “Rate My Apartment.” Oftentimes, students have difficulty selecting off-campus housing options that are right for them due to a lack of information available to them. However, being able to see other residents’ and students’ prior experiences will help students make an informed decision and find an apartment perfect for their needs. Our app provides a centralized location for all of the reviews and opinions about various apartments to be congregated at. This application is useful because it is personal to the area around it and will be more comprehensive than Google Reviews on locations as it is specifically geared towards features unique to an apartment.

Through this app, students will be able to learn about the apartment’s management, noise levels, wifi strength and many more factors essential to a student's success. Similar sites and applications include ApartmentRatings. However, the difference between ours and theirs is that ours is geared towards students and accommodating various study habits and academic lifestyles. As for the data, to make sure that it is validated, we will compile apartments from Zillow and other housing sources and insert them into our database. Users will also potentially have the ability to suggest new locations for us to add so that they can review them.
